# Lags

Lags let you align this period observations with past or forward expectations. Thus, lag(x, 1) is equivalent to aligning today's observations with yerstedays observations. Equivalently, lag(x, -1) will align today's observations with tomorrow's.

An important caveat is that the behavior of lags in xts is the opposite of the behavior of the lag in zoo and base R. 

```{r}
library(xts)
xtsobj <- as.xts( matrix(1:4, ncol = 2), as.Date(c("2014-02-01", "2014-03-01")))
cbind(xtsobj, lag(xtsobj, 1))
```


## Difference Operators

The difference operator computes the difference between todays' observations and yesterday's observation, or some period before. For example:

```{r}
diff(xtsobj - 1)
```
