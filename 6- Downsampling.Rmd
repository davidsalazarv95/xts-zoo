# To lower periodicity

Finance: OHLC: Open, High, Low, Close of a time series. Time series aggregation is just an application from splitting by group and applying a function to each group. For example, return the OHLC of each group. To do that automatically, use the to.period functions

```{r}
library(xts)
data(edhec, package = "PerformanceAnalytics") # load xts data
head(edhec)
```

```{r}
to.period(edhec[,1], period = "years", indexAt = "endof", OHLC = FALSE) # will always get last value of series
```

```{r}
to.yearly(edhec[,1], OHLC = FALSE)
```

To get the first value, do it manually:

```{r}
do.call(rbind, lapply(split(edhec[,1], "years"), first))
```
